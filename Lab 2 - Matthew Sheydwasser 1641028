Question 1:

The socket type is determined by the second arguement. We use SOCK_STREAM as a default for TCP

Question 2:

The difference between a client socket and server socket is that a client socket connects to a listening server. A server socket gets bound to a port and listens for any incoming connection from a client.

Question 3:

If we did not want the socket to reuse the same port, we would set the value of socket.SO_REUSEADDR to zero, because it will reuse an address if it is any nonzero value.

Question 4:

The information we recieve is the address that is connected to the server socket. This is the remote address (raddr) which includes the address and port.

Question 5:

Recv() returns the data sent to the server. In the case of using the command "echo 'Foobar' | nc localhost 8001 -q 1", the data returned will be b'Foobar\n'.

Question 6:
